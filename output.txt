I think that everybody ought to- ought to do the own research and listen to a lot of different points of view, so I'm certainly not the only voice. my particular, uh, voice is is that: with the background of an engineer, I went to MIT and I studied Aeronautical Engineering and spaceship design. so I have a engineering background. um, I have a long enthusiastic history as a tech investor, as an early investor in Amazon and Apple and Google and Facebook um. I wrote a book about the impact of Technology. especially mobile technology, on civilization and on the economy. that's based upon my studies at MIT. I studied science, technology and society, and the history of science is another one of my degrees. and then when I saw the Advent of the mobile phone, it became clear to me that that mobile phones were going to dematerialize cameras and tape recording and entertainment and relationships, and money and commerce and Retail storefronts and news, newspapers and books, and when I thought about the dematerialization of all that, I thought the world's going to change. there are going to be these trillion dollar companies like, like there are today- apple and Amazon, Google, Microsoft- I thought, um, that's going to make it difference. I wrote that book back in 2010, published it in 2012. I rode that mobile W for about a decade and um. I did that while I was running a company I created. I created a company when I was 24 called micro strategy. in 1998 we came public and micro strategy is is uh, mstr, it's still in business and I was the CEO. for 30 something years now I'm the executive chairman, so I spent a career running a public company. our company sells enterprise software to Banks and governments and Airlines and large corporations and most of the retailers in the world. so so, before I discovered Bitcoin, I had an engineering background, a tech investor background. I was a bit of a academic in the in the history of Science and I had a background in the real world running a software company that was multinational and I had a background as a public company CEO and, and along the way, I picked up lots of bruises. as a tech entrepreneur, I picked up, uh, lots of wisdom, learning what it's like to do business everywhere in the world and Along Comes 2020 and the pandemic crisis, and and, and there there's covid, and there were lockdowns, and then the interest rates went to zero and there was Financial hysteria and and the world was, uh, turned upside down and split in half. you know all of our office cultures, they all got thrown out the window and we all went to remote work and we did it like overnight. um, all our prejudices and biases. well, we think we should do it this way. they got thrown out the window and maybe we have to do it a different way. all of our thoughts about, uh, money and banking. it's like: okay, here's your money in the bank could earn 0% interest. well, what am I'm going to? and, by the way, we're inflating the currency and eventually everything's going to cost twice as much. houses are going to go up in price and yet your money is going to earn zero. that causes people to open their mind to new ideas, so in my case, I uh approached this existential risk in 2020, running a publicly traded company, and we happen to have two things: we had about 500 million in cash earning 0% interest and we had a $500 million software business generating about 75 million in cash flow, and our stock was a bit more than a billion dollars in value. so the marketplace put 1X multiple on our business and 1X multiple on the cash, and I looked at it. my first concern was: will the company survive the crisis you know in in March, April, May of 2020? we were all worried about. you know our lives, our family, our businesses, our business model. and once I realized that wasn't going away, my second, my second thought was: how is it possible that every Main Street business is having the worst year of their life? every restaurant, every bar, every gym, every yoga Salon, everyone you know that shows up to work. not only are they not working, they're not allowed to work. and if you open up your gym, you know people getting arrested for opening up a gym to get healthy. so on one side you have this crisis, half the people in the world, or half the businesses, are having the worst year of their life. and then, in the summer of 2020, all the Wall Street firms had the best year of their life. all the stocks doubled, all the real estate assets went through the roof. When we dropped the interest rate to zero, real estate property values double. you know, all of a sudden, you know all the big tech companies are shooting through the sky and S&P shooting through the sky, and I just saw this Paradox. how is it possible that one part of society thinks everything's great? and another part of society thinks this is the most awful thing. so we were worried a little bit about that, but really we thought, you know, $500 million is going to be worth $500 million in four years, except that you're going to need a billion dollars to buy the same amount of stuff as you could buy with $500 million today. so we're destroying shareholder value to sit in our position, the market doesn't care about us and we and, on the other hand, we don't own anything that's benefiting from all this inflation and from these low interest rates. so we started looking around and and you know, in that year my mind opened and I embrace a lot of new ideas. I embrac the idea of podcasting. I'd never done any podcasts until 2020. I embrac the idea of Zoom. I would have fired you in February if you wanted to do remote work, but in by the end of March it was mandatory, you know. so, yeah, it's like 10 years or 20 years of of innovation or Evolution, you know, all coming in a week or two weeks. then I thought, well, what am I going to do with this money? I either got to give it back to the shareholders, you know, and decapitalize. and if I decapitalize, I thought that's a fast death. right, our company was looking at a fast death, a slow death, or uh, do something new. and uh, I wasn't interested in the fast death, uh, the slow death didn't have a lot of appeal, just just uh get chipped away at by big tech companies, and so it's kind of a desperate moment, a Moment of Truth, where you have to make a decision and take a risk. and so we looked around and we and we said, well, what is what do we need right now? well, we need a hard asset that, uh, is scarce, that, um that people all want in the world and we need to get on top of the next big Tech Trend. you know like is it? is it, uh? digital relationships is it? digital books, is it? digital photographs. well, it's too late to jump on top of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. you had to hit them and invest in them. in 2010, 2012, I said: what's the next big thing and I thought: what about Facebook for money? what if someone actually invented a bank for that? that a billion people, or in this case, 8 billion people? needed, that ran on the internet, that actually had an asset which no government could debase, which every wealthy investor wants, which you could move with the speed of light that you could program into an iPhone. what is this? digital gold, digital Capital, digital property? what if the next wave is the digital transformation of money, of property, of energy, of all these ideas, they weren't transformed in the first internet wave. and I looked around, I thought, well that feels like crypto gold to me, and so what if I could create something that was better than gold? it had none of the defects of gold and, and, and it offered the promise of sound money to 8 billion people, and then I could combine that with a digital Network like Google, like Android or like iOS or like the internet. that struck me as being the next big idea, and so micro strategy became, uh, the first public company to buy Bitcoin, and we bought 250 million dollars of Bitcoin in August of 2020, and no one had ever made such a large commitment to this scary new, crazy crypto idea. you worried about volatility at the time that you could make that investment and have it drop by 80- 90% in a year. yeah, I was worried about volatility and and and the way that we dealt with that was we had 500 million in capital. I wasn't worried that it would drop and we would Panic sell it. I was worried that it would drop and our shareholders would would, uh, have a big issue with it and we might get suit, yeah, and so the way we dealt with it was: we announced that we were going to do a $250 million stock buyback at a premium. we call it Dutch auction and we paired it with a $250 million Bitcoin purchase and we allowed all of our shareholders to get out like, if you didn't, if you didn't buy into the Bitcoin strategy, you could tender your shares back to the company out at a premium that rotated our shareholder base and and and we didn't have neutral or indifferent shareholders. we had all Pro Bitcoin shareholders and that changed the dynamic of the company, it turned out. that uh, that Dutch auction uh resulted in only about $60 million of shares being tendered, so we had 175 million left at the end of the Dutch auction period 20 days later. yeah, and we bought another 175 million of Bitcoin, and then we had 425. so at this point, no one in the world- I think the largest public company- might have had one1 or2 million dollar of Bitcoin before that, and we come over the top with 425 million and we declared to the world that we thought this was going to be our primary treasury Reserve asset. right, this is the way we're going to run our Treasury, and that was. that was a a brand new idea. there's 43,000 public companies and we were the first one to say: let's not put your capital in bonds or cash or just give it away. let's invest the capital in this new liquid asset and this crypto asset called Bitcoin. when we did that, the stock doubled and we raised an another uh, $650 million MH, and then the stock went up again and we raised a billion dollars, and and we raised a billion dollars about six months after this initiative in a convertible debt offering at 0% interest. so we borrowed a billion dollars at 0% interest for about six years, I think yeah, and we went to buy Bitcoin with it. so that point you know we had said: not only do we think we're going to invest our free cash in Bitcoin, we're going to go ahead and we're going to borrow money to buy Bitcoin and while we were doing it, other public companies like uh square, and then Tesla started buying Bitcoin, and then all these Bitcoin miners came public. and so, from 2020 to 2024. that was the the crazy years of uncertainty. people weren't sure, you know. will Bitcoin be banned, will it be copied? will it be hacked? um? is it a long-term thing. the Skeptics thought: well, maybe you know some people, the deniers, said it's just tulip bulbs. other people, Skeptics, said, oh yeah, it's, it's really good, it's better than gold, but it's too good to be true, and so the government's going to take it away from you. and at one point, china banned Bitcoin mining, and that created a crisis. and then they banned Bitcoin trading, and that created a crisis, so a lot of uncertainty there. but our belief was: Bitcoin is the solution to 8 billion people's problem. it's the solution to 300 million companies problem. it's it's the Innovation, the, the biggest innovation in money or property rights in the history of the human race. it's like fire or electricity right. it's this new monetary protocol which is going to elevate Humanity to new levels. so so we became obviously very big Advocates. we raised 500 million in a senior debt issue to buy more Bitcoin. then we sold a billion doll of equity to buy Bitcoin. then we sold another, you know. then we borrowed money against Bitcoin to buy Bitcoin. then we issued more Equity to buy Bitcoin. if you fast forward through the four years today, as of today, since we started well, we've invested $7.5 billion in Bitcoin, which is worth any given day- 14 to 15 billion, the market cap of the company went from 1 billion to 30. the Enterprise value of the company went from 600 million to more- more than 30 so, and the stock 10x. so during that time, period, the company's stock outperformed just about every stock on the S&P index. it outperformed Nvidia and Tesla and Amazon and Apple and Google and Facebook. it outperformed Bitcoin itself and and- and it's not very often that you 10x a stock, 20x a market cap, 40x the Enterprise Value and 44 months. so we took a particular position, which is Bitcoin. is is a good strategy, it's good for the world and we're not going to be shaken and uh, while that was happening. obviously Bitcoin Bitcoin. when we bought it at at 11,800 it crashed down into the 9,000, so we took a m like a $40 million hit in the first week or two weeks. so it was very stressful. losing 40 million of 250 million- right, it's, it's a, it's a big thing, but we double down and then Bitcoin rallied up and it eventually rallied, went through the alltime highs and red to 66,000, then crashed down in the 40s, then rallied to the 66 again, and then this brutal crypto winner went from 66 all the way down to 16,000. brutal and then it rallied up and so it is today where it is, you know, and yeah, everybody's got their own Bitcoin Journey, but Micro strategy Bitcoin journey is we started out a desperation it was like: do this or maybe just shutter the company we went from. you know, desperate offensive, too opportunistic. hey, you know someone wants to give us $1.6 billion for nearly free for six years. if I offered you 1.6 billion for free for the next six years to invest in anything you wanted, would you take it absolutely? we asked Dave Ramsey the exact same question. he said: no, he wouldn't take it like like yeah, yeah, crazy, um, and you must not believe in anything, right? I mean, if you're in business and someone's offering you, in essence, free money to invest in your business for the next six years, and you don't want it. well, what it really means is you've run out of ideas, you don't know what to do with the capital, but, um, you know, we went to, we went from the first step to opportunistic, and then it became strategic and we realized this. we are a Bitcoin development company. our job is: to issue Securities and to engage in uh technology projects and advocacy and education in order to spread uh. you know. the, the virtues of Bitcoin and and the opportunities of Bitcoin to the world. how are you able to develop an ey to spot Innovation like that before the general public? were you always like this at growing up as a kid to be able to spot Trends. but before we get into that, guys, I have learned so much about building businesses and Entrepreneurship from the business experts we've had on this show. but if you're like me and you're always hungry for more. that's where I turn to our sponsor, masterclass. with Master Class, you could learn from the best to become your best. in fact, master class is is the only streaming platform where you could learn and grow with over 200 of the world's best for just $10 a month. an annual membership to masterclass gets you unlimited access to every single instructor. plus, you could access masterclass on your phone, smart TV, computer or even in audio mode like you could learn to build a business with Mark cubin, get world-class leadership training from Navy SEAL veteran Joo willink, or even take your cooking to the next level with Gordon Ramsay. matter of fact, James CLE, who wrote one of my favorite books of all time- Atomic habits- has a class that teaches you how to BU build habits that stick. he actually taught me one of my favorite ideas I've ever heard, which is that we do not rise to the level of our goals, but we actually fall to the level of our systems. so he really emphasizes how important it is to have strong systems in place. and the classes really make a difference. 88% of their members say that master classes had a positive impact on their lives. and, best of all, right now our listeners get an additional 15% off any annual membership at masterclasscom slist. that's 15% off at masterclasscom masterclass / IED: the link Down Below in the description. thank you so much, masterclass, for sponsoring this episode. and back to the podcast. how were you able to develop an ey to spot Innovation? like that before the general public? were you always like this at growing up as a kid to be able to spot Trends?\",\n    \"end_time\": 190.72\n  },\n  {\n    \"start_time\": 190.72,\n    \"transcribed_text\": \"I was a science fiction fanatic by the time I was in third grade, like, I think, I think, my parents. they, they, uh hacked me when I was in first grade. I had this comic book addiction and they offered me a dime for every, every real book I read. in some reading competition and comic books cost 25 cents and I calculated if I read two and a half books I could get a comic book, and so I read like 60- 70 books in the summer and I'd be like reading one a day, you know. and uh, I got into science fiction. I discovered all the great authors: Robert heinlin, Isaac azimoff. Arthur C Clark got very interested in that. it led me to a bit of fantasy. I you know I'm the kind of guy who played uh, board games, simulation games, before we had computers to simulate them on. we had to use- you know, dice, you know, and- and then I played Dungeons and Dragons and that got me into fantasy and all of that's about imagination and you know. one of the more famous books is have space suit will travel by hind line and and in the book you know, the hero discovers a spaceship, a space suit, fixes it up, it's broken, barking at the sky a spaceship lands, he gets picked up. he, gallivant across theit Universe, saves Humanity from the bugey monsters, comes back and uh, and as his rewarded gets a full tuition scholarship to MIT and I guess is stuck in my mind. you know that if, if, if you're the, you know the upwardly Mobile Alpha Male, you know Tech forward thinker, maybe you want to go to MIT. so I went to MIT to study spaceship design and I was going to be an astronaut and a spaceship designer, and that that brought me in touch with you know, some just extraordinary individuals, extra extraordinary professors. extraordinary students. like every one of my fraternity Brothers was like an eagle scout, right, like, like, okay, welcome. like everybody's a valoran, everybody's an eagle scout and they're all brilliant and what they do for you know for fun. they design space equipment or they hack the phone system or or or the like. and while I was there studying uh aerospace engineering, I stumbled on the history of Science and the history of science is all about. you know, how did we discover Immunology? how do we discover that the Earth, you know, revolves around the Sun? you know, like, how do we, how do we get through the capern revolution? what's the significance of Optics? why do we stop bleeding people to death? what's the significance of nuclear power? what's the significance of Maxwell's equations or Newtonian physics or relativity, and you know what, Madam curri, do for us. and how does the society react when you introduce a new technology, whether it's a railroad or an internal combustion engine or an airplane, and and uh. so if you look at the history of the world through a technology lens, right then you, you start to see things differently. so when I came out of MIT, you know, I had the science fiction background, I had the fantasy background, I had the history of I. I always loved history in general, but then the history of science really opened up my eyes to Paradigm shifts. I mean, one of the most basic principles of science is the Paradigm Shift everybody. Dr Harvey is the guy that discovered that the heart beats blood out through the arteries. it circulates back through the veins. for 10,000 years no doctor knew what the heart did and they didn't actually accept circulation. Harvey discovers it and everybody in the medical profession rejects it like no we don't believe you now, despite the fact they could probably determine this with some experiments. but they don't believe him. and Harvey says no physician over the age of 40 will ever believe me, ever. right then I think Max plank had had a a quote. he goes: you know, science advances one Death at a time. and Thomas cun says: in the structure of scientific revolutions, when you come up with a new, paradigm shift, whether it's, you know, the capern revolution right, the universe doesn't revolve around the earth. your diseases aren't caused by spirits and demons, but rather by little germs and you know, in the blood or relativity that Einstein put forward, in the Paradigm Shift of quantum physics, which Einstein rejected, or you know Quantum uncertainty cun says these Paradigm shifts take place only after the old dies or in a war. there only two ways you get people to turn the world upside down and see a new idea. they either. they either have to. you have to see the Old Guard die. we're seeing this in crypto right now. I mean, I go around and and I'll meet people and they'll say, yeah, my son told me I needed to talk to you. it's like the 20s. somethings, the 30-some, the teenagers, they all know the 50s something, 60s something, 70 somethings that they're hearing about. they're hearing it from their kids. so this is a generational thing up and um, I think you know. so I was fortunate because my advantage was I kind of had the academic B grounding. I had the passion. I was always very interested in in how do we invent new things with technology. I grew up in a coming of age where you know we started. there were three channels of broadcast television and then a rapid succession. you got to where we are today. so, um, I obviously some people are a little bit more uh, what is the word uh? open-minded. they've got more of a inclination- an INT intellectual inclination- to appreciate that than others. so I always had a bias toward it and I just had some really good um formative experiences and opportunities in order to feed that inclination. I'm curious: who were some of your biggest in influences or like Inspirations when you were younger. that kind of like- I don't know- maybe made you think the way that you think. and as you elevate the financial ladder and you make this crazy decision or controversial, I should say, to put hundreds of millions of dollars into Bitcoin, to turn it into billions of dollars. now that you have all of that money, who do you look to now for inspiration, and how's that changed?\",\n    \"end_time\": 245.68\n  },\n  {\n    \"start_time\": 245.68,\n    \"transcribed_text\": \"you know the great science fiction writers, you know, were Inspirations. uh, you know, hline in particular, not only is a good science fiction writer and he tells good story, but he's also libertarian. he's also a sound money advocate, so his, his writings are laced with with: uh, you know e conservative economics, practical, practical observations about politics, you know so. so a and uh, inspirational stories of, of improving Humanity with technology. I think that's a very important formative experience. you know Reagan Thatcher. they were very, very successful uh politicians in their day and they both preached limited government right uh power to the people. Ein Rand and and uh her, her books Atlas, Shrug, The Fountain Head, very inspirational science historians you know, and the you know, the historians. Alvin Toffler. you know the people are Mega Trends, Future Shock, all those books that were. you know how is the world going to going to turn upside down. I thought that was very in very interesting, inspirational and, I think, um you know, arthury Clark's got a phrase, a very famous statement. I put it on the back cover of my IPO perspectus in 1998. when the company came public. that's how important the phrase was, and his phrase was: any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from Magic, right and that and that was the Mantra of the great science fiction writers. where it blends with fantasy, it's like what's magic mirror? well, you know, I look in the mirror and I talk, and then somebody talks back. well, now you take. uh, you know. an iPad or you take an Apple computer and you look at it and you zoom to someone in Singapore and you talk and they talk back and that's getting pretty magical. but then, at the point where they take your photo and they plug you into an AI and they bring you to life and they put you into the, into cyberspace, and I'm talking to an AI That's talking back to to me with your gestures? am I talking to a demon, a witch, a demod, a person? you know what? where did the science stop? where did the fantasy begin? and and uh. that inspired me to start micro strategy and our idea was: Intelligence everywhere's. let's make everybody super intelligent like think about what some of these AIS can do today? you, you can basically ask the thing to scan the, the body, entire body of human writing. MH, you know, give me a Shakespearean Sonet, you. know but, and in the style of &m, And in 100 milliseconds or 500 milliseconds it comes back. you know what? uh Jack did that last night? yeah, we plugged, uh we said to chat GPT. if we were to interview Michael sailor, what should our format be? and my gosh, it gave us an outline that we would have probably spent an hour thinking of ourselves, and it did it in, I would say, probably more than an hour. it was pretty. I mean, we already had an outline. I'm just kind of curious what chat GPT could provide. and it was good that. did you pray to your patron saint? or your AI and your your demon or your angel in cyberspace for the answer you kind of did: yeah right, you actually is. I asked a hundred years ago a thousand years ago. ask God to guide me. and and fantasy novels. God's God becomes Gods. I ask the god of of of my podcast to guide me. and this is what they said, right, and, and so where does, where does fantasy, where does science end? I think, I think it is extraordinary inspirational because it starts, it opens, up your mind, right? it's like what happens if I dematerialize every book. that's uh, that's ever been written and I can put it an iPad. okay, well, I just gave a 100 million books to 8 billion people for a nickel- okay, well, that's interesting, that that's not linear thinking that, but that's like second, second order thinking. third order thinking is: okay, let's just dematerialize every book, and then let's read every book and let's give you, you know, the equivalent of a professor that's read every book and you can ask: the professor, anything you know, and the first order is: hey, do I, can you just give me enough money to print a bunch of books and give you a big library? but you know, printing the books is fish expensive for the civilization. giving you know, making you read them, is double fishlyn, you just read every book. look over my shoulder, think about what I ought to do and just do it. yeah, you're placing a lot of trust though in the AI, do you worry about that? and and people not having the self-sufficiency to be able to maybe see through some of that that might not apply to them or or or rely too heavily?\",\n    \"end_time\": 304.04\n  },\n  {\n    \"start_time\": 304.04,\n    \"transcribed_text\": \"oh yeah, well, look, we're all going to worry about a lot of stuff, right? when you get on an airplane, you get in a tube and you fly 6,000 miles and you know the window blows open. you'll freeze your death or you'll suffocate, you know, before anybody can do anything about it. but meanwhile, on, on, probably don't think about it. you want me to make you worry, cuz I'm an aeronautical engineer. on approach right, if the pilot takes his eye off. you know off the approach for and gets unstable for two seconds. the plane may go into a stale SP Tail Spin, you're going to crash and burn and there's not a single thing you can do about it. and does it ever occur to you? to worry about what the pilot drank the night before he got into the plan. see what I? what I'm concerned about is if you have a mentally unstable pilot that wants to, like you know, do a lot of of harm to a lot of people. that's what I'm concerned about. but we can speculate all we want. Graham and I are horrified of flying, as it is like I look over at him, fine for a while, but like, yeah, I was, I was fine up until. let me f with you a bit more, which is okay. are we going to worry about AI Bots driving your car and are you worried about someone taking over the car and you know, and crashing? the AI driven car, or next time you go into New York City or wherever you go and you call an Uber? does it occurred to you that, no matter how well you eat, how well you drink, how well you live your life, how careful you are, how good a shape you're in that the random person that picked you up in the Uber in two seconds can drive you off the bridge and kill you with no chance to appeal. right, your life is basically in the hands of a random driver every time you get in a taxi cab. and you ought to be a lot more afraid of that than getting on the airplane, because least with the airplane there's two pilots and they- and, by the way, it's it's against professional rules and he will get fired, or or she will get fired if they drink or- and there's another person to look at them and assess whether they're sober when they walk on the airplane- and if they lose it or sneeze or or have a seizure, there's another person to land the plane. now I'm going to put you back in the random Uber in a foreign country that's swerving in traffic and okay if you think, oh, I'm too smart because, uh, I own you know I breathalyze tests and I personality test the Uber driver when I get in the car. maybe you think that? has it occurred to you that the guy on the other side of you know of the median strip can just take a drug, drink a thing and do this. but but I think about that from time to time as I'm driving, because you hear just random stories of exactly that of just a car that just made the wrong turn and just hit somebody who was in their Lane doing exactly as they should. driving the speed 's a point to all this, yeah, which is people used to die falling off their horse a lot. you just don't read about it because we didn't take good records. and if you roll the clock back to 1950 without technology, the average life expectancy was 50. if you roll the clock back to 1770, the average life expectancy was 32. people actually walked past the swamp, got bit by mosquito and died of of malaria or some fever, or they just they lived in a house that didn't have heat and they died of pneumonia, and people are dying of all sorts of things before we had technology. now we live in the 20, you know the early 21st century, and there's a million things for you to worry about, but if comp, if we unleash Ai and the, and the robots drive the cars and they fly the airplanes, it's more likely than not the case that the average number of traffic deaths fall in this, in the same way that in the modern era of antibi biotics and hospitals, and Modern Dentistry. you live in extra 30 years, even though you're taking some kind of risk when you do it. yeah, we can worry about it all. there'll be a debate. there's going to be politicians that'll say: you're safer in a car driven by a person than in a car driven by a computer. that probably won't be the case, but people will believe it's the case. and and that's above our pay grade, right, it's going to be determined, you know, regardless of what you think about"
